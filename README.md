## Features

## Local testing

### Run tests with coverage
There's a coverage.sh file that runs every test in the project located at `bin/coverage.sh` and needs permissions to run. It can be easily done executing the following command:

```
chmod +x coverage.sh
```

Now you can execute the file in the terminal
